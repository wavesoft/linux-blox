# Terms

In this document I consolidate all the terms I will use in this project.


 * __Blox__: A directory that contains the definition and the payload of an isolated linux package.
 * __Environment__: A dependency resolution subsystem which is used in order to make a blox aware of it's dependencies. For example the `PATH` environment variable in linux.
